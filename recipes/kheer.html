    <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Rice Kheer is a classic Indian dessert made with rice, milk, sugar, and nuts. It's a creamy and flavorful treat that's perfect for any occasion. This recipe uses simple ingredients and comes together easily for a delicious homemade dessert.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup basmati rice, rinsed</li>
    <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar (or to taste)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped nuts (cashews, almonds, pistachios, or a mix)</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>A few strands of saffron (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ghee (or butter)</li>
    <li>Rosewater (optional, to taste)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, heat the ghee over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Add the rinsed basmati rice and cook for a minute or two, stirring occasionally, until lightly toasted.</li>
    <li>Pour in the milk and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover partially, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the milk has thickened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li>Add the sugar and cardamom powder. Stir well and simmer for another 5 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves and the kheer reaches your desired consistency (slightly thicker than porridge).</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat. If using saffron, add it now and let it steep for a few minutes to release its flavor.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chopped nuts. Add a few drops of rosewater (optional) for a touch of floral aroma. Taste and adjust sweetness if needed.</li>
    <li>Serve the kheer warm or chilled, garnished with additional nuts and saffron (optional).</li>
  </ol>
