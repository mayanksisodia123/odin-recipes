      <li>1/2 cup cashew nuts, soaked and ground into a paste (optional, for a richer gravy)</li>

    </ul>
  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat oil in a pan or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook for another minute, stirring constantly.</li>
      <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and green chili pepper (if using) and cook until the tomatoes become mushy, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala. Stir well and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Pour in 1/2 cup of water and bring to a simmer. Add salt to taste.</li>
      <li>Add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. If using frozen spinach, add it here and cook until heated through.</li>
      <li> (Optional) If using cashew paste, stir it in at this stage and simmer for a further 2-3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Gently add the cubed paneer and simmer for 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
      <li>Stir in the heavy cream (or coconut milk) and bring to a gentle simmer. Do not boil.</li>
      <li>Adjust seasoning with salt and red chili powder (if needed). Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with rice or naan.</li>
